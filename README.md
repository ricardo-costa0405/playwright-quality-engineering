End-to-end test suite for [Swag Labs](https://www.saucedemo.com) built with Playwright and TypeScript.

Covers login, inventory, cart, checkout, product details, and mobile smoke tests across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

This framework was built with the assistance of **Playwright MCP** (for browser automation and element extraction during development) and **Playwright CLI** (for test generation, debugging, and inspector workflows). See [Tooling Notes](#tooling-notes-playwright-mcp--cli) at the bottom for observations on both.

## Features

- Page Object Model with a shared `BasePage`
- Custom fixtures for authenticated page state
- Multi-browser: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit (desktop + mobile emulation)
- Zero hardcoded timeouts — ESLint enforces state-based waits
- AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) validated across all specs
- Three CI workflows: desktop, mobile, smoke (GitHub Actions)
- JUnit + HTML + Allure reporting

## Installation

```bash
npm install
npm run install:browsers
```

No `.env` setup needed — this framework targets Swag Labs exclusively and all defaults are pre-configured.

---

## Running Tests

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run test:web` | Desktop tests (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) |
| `npm run test:web-mobile` | Mobile emulation (Pixel 5, iPhone 13, Galaxy S24) |
| `npm run test:all` | Desktop + mobile |
| `npm run test:smoke` | Smoke tests only (`@smoke` tag) |
| `npm run test:web:headed` | Desktop tests in headed mode |
| `npm run test:web:debug` | Desktop tests in debug mode |

---

## Reports

```bash
npm run report:serve      # Open Playwright HTML report
npm run report:allure     # Generate and open Allure report
```

---

## Code Quality

```bash
npm run lint              # ESLint
npm run format            # Prettier
npm run type-check        # TypeScript (no emit)
npm run validate:aaa      # Check AAA structure in all specs
npm run validate:timeouts # Detect hardcoded waits
```

---

## CI

Three GitHub Actions workflows run on push and pull requests to `main`:

- `web-tests.yml` — desktop browsers, matrix across Chromium, Firefox, WebKit
- `web-mobile-tests.yml` — mobile device emulation (Pixel 5, iPhone 13, Galaxy S24)
- `smoke-tests.yml` — fast smoke pass, posts results as a PR comment

Artifacts (JUnit XML, HTML report, traces) are uploaded per run with 30-day retention. Screencast recordings are kept for 7 days on failure only.

## Tooling Notes: Playwright MCP & CLI

### Playwright CLI

Used during development for:
- `npx playwright codegen` — generates test code by recording browser interactions
- `npx playwright test --debug` / `--ui` — step-through debugging with the Inspector
- `npx playwright show-report` — reviewing traces and failure screenshots locally

**Pros:** Zero setup, ships with Playwright, great for quick exploration and trace review.
**Cons:** Codegen produces fragile selectors (CSS/XPath) that need manual cleanup to `data-test` attributes. The Inspector is headful only, so not usable in CI.

### Playwright MCP

Used during development for programmatic browser control from an AI agent context:
- Extracting elements and their accessible roles/attributes to inform selector choices
- Navigating and interacting with pages to verify selectors before writing specs
- Reproducing failures in a controlled session without running the full suite

**Pros:** Allows AI-assisted element discovery with real browser context; respects the selector priority hierarchy (`data-test` → role → text) when querying. Useful for validating selectors against the live DOM before committing them to page objects.
**Cons:** Requires the MCP server running locally (`.mcp/servers.json`). Not a replacement for the test runner — used only for authoring assistance, not execution.
